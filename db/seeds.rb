I love touring and will continue to play live shows, but in staying open to what’s driving me creatively, it felt like making more music was the most inspired feeling I had. I know the Sob Rock tour was only in the US, and though I will make it to other cities and countries in the future, I’ve just got more songs to make. I’m having the time of my life writing and recording, and it won’t be long before I share some very exciting news about some new projects. I’m grateful beyond description for all the love and support I’ve got in you all, and I’m the luckiest person in the world to still be on this big beautiful ride with you all. ♥️ (photos by @daniel)")

I’m blown away by the generosity of my friends @bobweir and @davechappelle and can’t wait to celebrate this awesome community with those who share my love for it. Don’t be mad if the tickets sell out (they may be gone by the time you read this) but do text \“Flood22\” to 41444 if you care to contribute. Head to johnmayer.com for tickets.")
    post5_john = Post.create!(user_id: john_mayer.id, caption: "These tours with @deadandcompany exist on an almost otherworldly plane - everyone, on stage and in the crowd, meets up in this shared dream, and on the last night, after the final note is struck, we leave it all on the stage. We bow, we hug, we share our love for one another and then… we disappear. I fly through the dead of night and wake up at home, where my ears ring, my heart sings, and I’m left with this mix of fatigue, joy, accomplishment, and deep appreciation for what I was able to be a part of. I can feel the connected, collective experience of thousands of others who wake up feeling the same. I’ll never get over the profound beauty and uniqueness of this, and we’ll never in our lifetime see the likes of @bobweir @mickeyhart and @billkreutzmann, playing beyond all perceived limitations and expectations. It’s nothing short of remarkable. Thank you one and all for allowing me a seat on this transcendent ride. ♥️")
